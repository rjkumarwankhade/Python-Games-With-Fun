# Python Game Project - Raj

This project includes three simple games implemented in Python and presented through a graphical user interface using the `tkinter` library.

## Games Included

1. **Heads and Tails Game:**
   - Simulates a coin toss where the user can guess "Heads" or "Tails."
   - The result is determined randomly, and the user is notified if they win or lose.

2. **Dice Game:**
   - Asks the user to guess a number between 1 and 6, simulating a dice roll.
   - The program compares the user's guess with the actual dice result and declares whether the user wins or lose.

3. **Cubes Game:**
   - Prompts the user to input a number.
   - Prints the cubes of numbers in reverse order, starting from the user's input.
